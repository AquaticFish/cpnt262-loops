## Code Journal
 **Notes:** 
 In js, there are several types of loops, but two of the most common ones are the for loop and the while loop.The while loop is used when you don't know in advance how many times the loop should run. It continues to execute the block of code as long as the specified condition is true

**Self-Assessments:** 
the diamond pattern was quite challenging, I had a hard time figuring out the math to the stars, overall i'll give my self 5/10. had to research all lot to understand.
